# search-for-unsound-fstar-and-vampire
Looking for unsoundness when using `vampire` as a backend for `fstar`.

As seen in [this issue](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues/2868), some encodings can be interpreted as unsound by vampire. This repository tries to look for them in order to discuss if they are soundness issues or `z3` black magic.
